Undergraduate Thesis at Virtualized Network Functions area using Click and ClickOS as major tools.

The specific subject is not well-defined yet, but now I'm building some VNF's as Router, Firewall and NAT.
In next step, will be build a load balancer.

Paralleling to this, I and others undergraduates students, masters students, doctorates students and doctors from Núcleo de Estudos em Redes Definidas por Software (NERDS) submitted the VNFs and ClickOS subject to a National Symposium know as Simpósio Brasileiro de Redes de Computadores (SBRC).
