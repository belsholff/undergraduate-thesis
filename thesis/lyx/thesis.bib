	abstract = {Click is a new software architecture for building flexible and configurable routers. A Click router is assembled from packet processing modules called elements. Individual elements implement simple router functions like packet classification, queueing, scheduling, and interfacing with network devices. Complete configurations are built by connecting elements into a graph; packets flow along the graph's edges. Several features make individual elements more powerful and complex configurations easier to write, including pull processing, which models packet flow driven by transmitting interfaces, and flow-based router context, which helps an element locate other interesting elements.We demonstrate several working configurations, including an IP router and an Ethernet bridge. These configurations are modular---the IP router has 16 elements on the forwarding path---and easy to extend by adding additional elements, which we demonstrate with augmented configurations. On commodity PC hardware running Linux, the Click IP router can forward 64-byte packets at 73,000 packets per second, just 10\% slower than Linux alone.},

By decoupling NFs from the physical equipment on which they run, NFV promises to reduce CAPEX and OPEX, make networks more scalable and flexible, and lead to increased service agility. However, despite the unprecedented interest it has gained, there are still obstacles that must be overcome before NFV can advance to reality in industrial deployments, let alone delivering on the anticipated gains. While doing so, important challenges associated with network and function MANO need to be addressed. In this article, we introduce NFV and give an overview of the MANO framework that has been proposed by ETSI. We then present representative projects and vendor products that focus on MANO, and discuss their features and relationship with the framework. Finally, we identify open MANO challenges as well as opportunities for future research.},

By decoupling network functions (NFs) from the physical devices on which they run, NFV has the potential to lead to significant reductions in operating expenses (OPEX) and capital expenses (CAPEX) and facilitate the deployment of new services with increased agility and faster time-to-value. The NFV paradigm is still in its infancy and there is a large spectrum of opportunities for the research community to develop new architectures, systems and applications, and to evaluate alternatives and trade-offs in developing technologies for its successful deployment. In this paper, after discussing NFV and its relationship with complementary fields of software defined networking (SDN) and cloud computing, we survey the state-of-the-art in NFV, and identify promising research directions in this area.

Despite these features, Click still has no native TCP support and only uses nonblocking I/O, preventing its applicability to middleboxes that require access to L7 data and blocking I/O. We bridge this gap by introducing Click middleboxes (CliMB). CliMB provides a full-fledged modular TCP layer supporting congestion control, TCP options, both blocking and nonblocking I/O, as well as socket and zero-copy APIs to applications. As a result, any TCP network function may now be realized in Click. As proof of concept, we develop a zero-copy SOCKS proxy server using CliMB that shows up to 4x gains compared to an equivalent implementation using the Linux in-kernel network stack.},

This approach, besides effective, presents many disadvantages such as increased operational costs, difficulties to scale up or down the network, and deploy new functions. The rise of virtualization technologies, on the other side, provides new ways to rethink about network functions. Instead of specialized and expensive hardware, multiple network functions can share the same commodity hardware, thus contributing to a better utilization of resources. Besides its advantages, NFV is still on its early stages of employment. Important aspects are not yet being investigated by the research community. For example, to this date, the management requirements of NFV remain unclear. Therefore, the present paper addresses this subject, it presents a realistic network function request, which is used to identify management requirements in the context of a specific NFV enabler platform called ClickOS.},

Despite their usefulness, they come with a number of problems, many of which arise from the fact that they are hardware-based: they are costly, difficult to manage, and their functionality is hard or impossible to change, to name a few. To address these issues, there is a recent trend towards network function virtualization (NFV), in essence proposing to turn these middleboxes into software-based, virtualized entities. Towards this goal we introduce ClickOS, a high-performance, virtualized software middlebox platform. ClickOS virtual machines are small (5MB), boot quickly (about 30 milliseconds), add little delay (45 microseconds) and over one hundred of them can be concurrently run while saturating a 10Gb pipe on a commodity server. We further implement a wide range of middleboxes including a firewall, a carrier-grade NAT and a load balancer and show that ClickOS can handle packets in the millions per second.},

Yet, till now there is little understanding about its performance in practice. In this paper, we make a benchmark measurement study of NFV software dataplanes in terms of packet processing capability, one of the most fundamental and critical performance metrics. Specifically, we compare two state-of-the-art open-source NFV dataplanes, SoftNIC and ClickOS, using commodity 10GbE NICs under various typical workloads. Our key observations are that (1) both dataplanes have performance issues processing small ({\textless}=128B) packets; (2) it is not always best to put all VMs of a service chain on one server due to NUMA effect. We propose resource allocation strategies to remedy the problems, including carefully adding CPU cores and vNICs to VMs, and spreading VMs of a service chain to separate servers. To fundamentally address these problems and scale their performance, SoftNIC and ClickOS could improve the support for NIC queues and multiple cores.},

Past solutions have seen the use of hardware assistance, in the form of "PCI passthrough" (dedicating parts of physical NICs to each virtual machine) and even bouncing traffic through physical switches to handle data forwarding and replication. In this paper we show that, with a proper design, very high speed communication between virtual machines can be achieved completely in software. Our architecture, called VALE, implements a Virtual Local Ethernet that can be used by virtual machines, such as QEMU, KVM and others, as well as by regular processes. VALE achieves a throughput of over 17 million packets per second (Mpps) between host processes, and over 2 Mpps between QEMU instances, without any hardware assistance. VALE is available for both FreeBSD and Linux hosts, and is implemented as a kernel module that extends our recently proposed netmap framework, and uses similar techniques to achieve high packet rates.},

Developing new NFs remains a tedious process, requiring that developers repeatedly rediscover and reapply the same set of optimizations, while current techniques for providing isolation between NFs (using VMs or containers) incur high performance overheads. In this paper we describe NetBricks, a new NFV framework that tackles both these problems. For building NFs we take inspiration from modern data analytics frameworks (e.g., Spark and Dryad) and build a small set of customizable network processing elements. We also embrace type checking and safe runtimes to provide isolation in software, rather than rely on hardware isolation. NetBricks provides the same memory isolation as containers and VMs, without incurring the same performance penalties. To improve I/O efficiency, we introduce a novel technique called zero-copy software isolation.},

	abstract = {In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of high speed packet I/O frameworks, bringing unprecedented network performance to userspace. Using the Click modular router, we first review and quantitatively compare several such packet I/O frameworks, showing their superiority to kernel-based forwarding. We then reconsider the issue of software packet processing, in the context of modern commodity hardware with hardware multi-queues, multi-core processors and non-uniform memory access. Through a combination of existing techniques and improvements of our own, we derive modern general principles for the design of software packet processors. Our implementation of a fast packet processor framework, integrating a faster Click with both Netmap and DPDK, exhibits up-to about 2.3x speed-up compared to other software implementations, when used as an IP router.},

	title = {Extending {Networking} into the {Virtualization} {Layer}},
	abstract = {The move to virtualization has created a new network access layer residing on hosts that connects the various VMs. Virtualized deployment environments impose re- quirements on networking for which traditional models are not well suited. They also provide advantages to the networking layer (such as software flexibility and well- defined end host events) that are not present in physical networks. To date, this new virtualization network layer has been largely built around standard Ethernet switching, but this technology neither satisfies these new requirements nor leverages the available advantages. We present Open vSwitch, a network switch specifically built for virtual environments. Open vSwitch differs from traditional approaches in that it exports an external interface for fine-grained control of configuration state and forwarding behavior. We describe how Open vSwitch can be used to tackle problems such as isolation in joint-tenant environments, mobility across subnets, and distributing configuration and visibility across hosts.},
